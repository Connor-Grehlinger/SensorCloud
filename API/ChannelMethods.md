Add Channel Attribute
---------------------
Add a custom attribute to the channel.  Each channel can have up to 25 custom attributes.  An attribute is of the type Text, Numeric, Boolean, or Custom.  A Text Attribute is a UTF-8 formatted string.  Numeric is a text representation of a number in either fixed point notation or scientific notation ^[-+]?[0-9]+((.[0-9]+)?([eE][0-9]+)?)?$ .  Boolean is a “false” or “true” string.  Custom is an arbitrary string of bytes.

### Request
Method | POST/PUT
-------|---------
Url    | ```/SensorCloud/devices/<device_id>/sensors/<sensor_name>/channels/<channel_name>/attributes/<attribute_name>/?version=1&auth_token=<auth_token>```
Headers| Content-Type: application/xdr

Content: XDR
```D
enum		{TEXT=0, NUMBER=1, CUSTOM=2, BOOL=3 } attributeType

int    		version=1;	/* int, always 1, may change with future versions */
attributeType 	type;        	/* type of the attributes type */
opaque 		value<500>;  	/* byte array, attribute value, 0-500 bytes */
```

### Response
* ***Success***: 201 Attribute Set
* ***Errors***:
  * 404 Not Found - A channel name was used that doesn't exist
  * 400 Attribute Limit - Cannot create a new attribute because there are currently 25 existing attributes.  25 is the maximum allowed.

Bulk Add Channel Attribute
--------------------------
Add multiple custom attributes to the channel at one time.  Each channel can have up to 25 custom attributes.  An attribute is of the type Text, Numeric, Boolean, or Custom.  A Text Attribute is a UTF-8 formatted string.  Numeric is a text representation of a number in either fixed point notation or scientific notation ^[-+]?[0-9]+((.[0-9]+)?([eE][0-9]+)?)?$ .  Boolean is a “false” or “true” string.  Custom is an arbitrary string of bytes.

Get Channel Attributes
----------------------
Get all sensor attributes for a channel.  An attribute is of the type Text, Numeric, Boolean, or Custom.  A Text Attribute is a UTF-8 formatted string.  Numeric is a text representation of a number in either fixed point notation or scientific notation ^[-+]?[0-9]+((.[0-9]+)?([eE][0-9]+)?)?$ .  Boolean is a “false” or “true” string.  Custom is an arbitrary string of bytes.

Get Channel Attribute
---------------------
Get a single attribute for a channel.  An attribute is of the type Text, Numeric, Boolean, or Custom.  A Text Attribute is a UTF-8 formatted string.  Numeric is a text representation of a number in either fixed point notation or scientific notation ^[-+]?[0-9]+((.[0-9]+)?([eE][0-9]+)?)?$ .  Boolean is a “false” or “true” string.  Custom is an arbitrary string of bytes.
