    "### SensorCloud + LIFX Example\n",
    "\n",
    "At LORD Sensing, we have a variety of in-house demos showing off our Sensors. But no demo is more valuable to us than our Coffee Lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We installed a [TC-Link-6Ch](http://www.microstrain.com/wireless/tc-link-6ch) onto our Coffee Maker to help us identify when a fresh pot of coffee is being brewed, as well as how old the current pot of coffee is. The TC-Link is continuously sampling at 1Hz, measuring the temperature of the brew spout. A [WSDA-1500](http://www.microstrain.com/wireless/wsda-1500) is collecting the data and pushing it to SensorCloud. This MathEngine script is running, analyzing the data, and making decisions based on the temperature data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TC-Link installed on the Coffee Maker](http://files.microstrain.com/coffeeDemo/tclink_close.jpg)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">*The TC-Link is using multiple thermocouples for measuring different parts of the coffee maker. The data obtained from the brew spout is what we currently use for a good/bad indicator.*</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for everyone to have a good indicator of the coffee, we decided to use [LIFX](http://www.lifx.com/) bulbs set up throughout the building. When the coffee is being brewed, the temperature quickly ramps up to around 94&deg;C (201&deg;F), at which point we flash the lights green for about a minute to indicate that it is brewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Coffee is brewing!](http://files.microstrain.com/coffeeDemo/coffeeLight.gif)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">*The coffee light is flashing green...coffee is brewing!*</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We then keep the lights a solid green until the temperature drops below 60&deg;C (140&deg;F). Below 60&deg;C, we change the lights to blue to indicate the coffee is still ok...just not completely fresh. When the temperature gets below 50&deg;C (122&deg;F), we turn off the lights. At this point, the coffee has been sitting for a while...coffee afficionados beware.\n",
